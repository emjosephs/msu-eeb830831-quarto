[Yaniv Brandvain](https://cbs.umn.edu/directory/yaniv-brandvain)'s online statistics textbook inspired this project and he has answered so many of my statistical and logistical questions.

This course section was originally developed by [Gideon Bradburd](https://lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/faculty/gideon-bradburd.html]) and I learned a ton from teaching it.

[Doc Edge](https://edgepopgen.github.io/edgelab/) and his [cool statistics textbook](https://academic.oup.com/book/43993) have been big sources of statistical knowledge.
