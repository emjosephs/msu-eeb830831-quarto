This is a lab to practice simple linear models with means and categories.

We will be simulating data to use in this model.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
palette <- c( "#FF5300", "#9ED80B", "#172869", "#43B629", "#8F92A1", "#1BB6AF")
```

Biological scenario goes here


```{r}
set.seed(20)
myData = rnorm(n=100, mean=2, sd=.5)


```
