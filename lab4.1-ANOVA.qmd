This is a lab to practice categorical linear models and ANOVA

You will be simulating data to use in this model.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
palette <- c( "#FF5300", "#9ED80B", "#172869", "#43B629", "#8F92A1", "#1BB6AF")
library(emmeans)
library(car)
```

Trout lilys (*Erythronium americanum*) have two distinct anther color morphs: yellow or red. The ecological consequences of anther color are unknown. Ripley and colleagues were interested in whether anther color affected pollinator preference. They went to a population of red-anthered flowers and counted the number of pollinator visits to local red flowers, and red and yellow flowers from a population 19km away. They chose these categories to disentangle the effects of color from the effects of novelty.

(scenario is from https://doi.org/10.17912/micropub.biology.001286)

We will start by simulating data under this model using a normal distribution and 3 categories: local red (1), distant red  (2), and distant yellow (3). They had 30 flowers of each type.

```{r}

n.1 <- 30
n.2 <- 30
n.3 <- 30
mean.1 <- 29
mean.2 <- 42
mean.3 <- 46
sd.1 <- 6

set.seed(5)

#sample fitnesses based on parameters above (the round function gives us integers)
group1 <- round(
  rnorm(n=n.1, mean=mean.1, sd=sd.1))
group2 <- round(
  rnorm(n=n.2, mean=mean.2, sd=sd.1))
group3 <- round(
  rnorm(n=n.3, mean=mean.3, sd=sd.1))

## but data together in a dataframe
simData <- data.frame(resp = c(group1, group2, group3), 
		    pop=c(rep('1', n.1), rep('2', n.2),rep('3',n.3)))

#look at it
plot(jitter(rep(c(0, .5,1), c(n.1, n.2,n.3))), simData$resp, bty="n", xlim=c(-.5,1.5),
     xlab = "", ylab = "number of visits", xaxt="n")
axis(1, at=c(0,.5,1), lab = c('red local','red distant','yellow distant'))

```

Make a linear model with lm()

```{r}
model1 <- lm(resp~pop, data=simData)
summary(model1)
```

Q1. How do you interpret the output of the linear model? What do the results tell you about pollinator behavior?


Next, we'll use this data to do an ANOVA to determine how much flower type in general affects pollinator visitation

```{r}
library(broom)

## Calculate SS_groups
SS_groups <- sum((augment(model1)$.fitted - mean(simData$resp))^2)

## Calculate MS_groups
MS_groups <- SS_groups/(3-1)

## Calculate SS_error
SS_error <- sum((augment(model1)$.resid)^2)
##SS_error <- sum((augment(model1)$resp - augment(model1)$.fitted)^2) THIS ALSO WORKS

## Calculate MS_error
MS_error <- SS_error/(90-3)

## Calculate F
myF = MS_groups/MS_error

## Do the F test
pf(q=myF, df1 = 2, df2 = 87, lower.tail=F)

```

Now we'll do an ANOVA with lm()

```{r}
Anova(model1)
```

Q2: Do you results match?

Now we will use the ANOVA to compare pollinator visits between all pairs of categories.

```{r}
em1 <- emmeans(model1, specs="pop")
pairs(em1)

```

Q3: Interpret the results of the analysis above? What matters most for determining pollinator visits?


Q4: Ripley et al. discover a rare purple-anthered morph. They repeat the experiment including the purple anthered morph. Copy and edit the code above to simulate data for an additional category with a mean of 2 visits per flower.


Q5: Rerun the linear model, ANOVA (with the anova() function), and emmeans on this new data. Interpret the outputs.
