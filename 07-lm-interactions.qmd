## What are we doing here?

We previously discussed linear models and learned to build a very simple linear model to estimate the mean. We also learned how to calculate residuals, which in this case were the differences between each datapoint and the mean.

In this section we'll expand our linear model to incorporate differences between categories.

## Motivating example
