For now though, pretend that you don’t know these rules because this chapter will focus on using simulations to understand probability.\nOne of the most powerful tools that we’ll have in our statistics learning toolkit are simulations. Simulations let you generate data that you know should look a certain way, so you can test your intuitions. Simulations also let you do the same thing over and over and over.\nLet’s start by simulating our class. We’ll create a vector with a number corresponding to each person in the class.\n\nthisClass = 1:25\nthisClass\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\n\nNow let’s use the R function sample() to sample a random person from the class.\n\nsample(thisClass, size=1)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nWe can do this again to conduct a second sample.\n\nsample(thisClass, size=1)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nWe can use sample() to answer the following questions:\nIf we randomly pick a student, how likely are we to select student #19?\n\nmySamples &lt;- replicate(1000, sample(thisClass, size=1))\nsum(mySamples==19)/10000\n\n[1] 0.0033\n\n\nWhat we’ve done here is write code that samples one student from the class and then we’ve used replicate() to repeat that sampling 1000 times. After that, we checked how many times we sampled student #19.",
