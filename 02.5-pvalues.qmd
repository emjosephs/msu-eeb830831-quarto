## What are we doing here?

In this chapter, we'll talk about the concept of likelihood and how we can use it to make statistical inferences from our data.



## Motivating question
Someone hands us a coin and we flip it 100 times and get 46 heads. 

Is the coin fair? (probability of heads = 50%)

What is the _most likely_ probability of flipping heads for this coin?
