penguins2 <- penguins |> filter(!is.na(body_mass) & !is.na(bill_len)) ##filter out ones 
```

## What are we doing here?


## Motivating example

In the previous sections, we found that both species and bill length affect body mass. Can we build a model that incorporates both?

```{r}
model2 <- lm(body_mass~bill_len+species,data=penguins2)
summary(model2)
```
