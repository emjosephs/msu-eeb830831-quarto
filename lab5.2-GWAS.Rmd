# Lab 5 (part 2) GWAS.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this lab we'll be using [GAPIT](https://github.com/jiabowang/GAPIT) to conduct a GWAS. Check out their website for information on installation. I'd suggest installing it with the following approach:

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages('devtools')
library('devtools')
devtools::install_github("jiabowang/GAPIT",force=TRUE)

```

Below is code to run GWAS on an Arabidopsis dataset
```{r}
library(GAPIT)

phenos <- read.table('data/phenotypes.pheno')
```
