b) Did the paper use p values to support the results?
c) What cut-offs (alpha values) were used? Were these explained or justified in the paper?
d) Where there other statistical techniques used to support significance of the results?

2. Collect all the p values used in the papers of every group member and make a histogram of them. Discuss this histogram, do you notice anything interesting?
