## What are we doing here?

In this chapter, we'll talk about the basics of probability and learn how to simulate data to investigate the probability in different scenarios.

There are lots of reasons we might care about probability.

-   Many important biological processes are influenced by chance so we need probability to describe these processes.

-   We don't want to tell science stories about coincidences. We can use probability to describe the potential for our data to be shaped by coincidence vs the process we are interested in.

-   Understanding probability helps us understand statistics!

## Definitions

### Sample Space

The **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes. For example, when you flip a coin the possible outcomes are heads and tails.


### Probability

We can think about the **probability** of some outcome as the frequency of that outcome within the sample space.
