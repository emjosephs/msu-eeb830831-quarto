## What are we doing here?


## Learning goals
- Apply and interpret different ways to measure variation
- Define a scientific hypothesis, determine appropriate null hypotheses.
- Calculate and interpret p values for a linear model based on t and F distributions.
- Calculate and interpet p values from likelihood ratio tests.

## The population vs the sample recap



## Measuring variance

### Standard error

## Hypothesis testing
Null hypothesis

## P values from distributions
### T distribution 

### Degrees of freedom

### Calculating a p value

### F distribution

## Likelihood ratio tests

Likelihood ratio tests compare the likelihood of the best model given the data with the likeliood of the model under the null hypothesis.

The difference in log likelihoods ($D$) will follow a $\chi ^2$ distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of parameters tested.
